This Privacy Policy describes how the **Facial Attendance System** ("we," "us," or "our") collects, stores, uses, and protects your information. This policy is drafted in compliance with the **Information Technology Act, 2000** and the **Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011** (SPDI Rules) of India.

*   **Name**: To identify the user for attendance records.
*   **User ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each user.

### B. Sensitive Personal Data or Information (SPDI)
*   **Facial Biometrics**: The App captures your facial image to generate a mathematical representation (facial embedding) for recognition purposes. **We do not store the original raw images of your face; only the encrypted facial embeddings are stored.**

### C. Device Permissions
*   **Camera**: Required to capture facial images for attendance marking.
*   **Storage**: Required to store the database and logs locally on your device.

The information collected is used solely for the following purposes:
*   To verify your identity during attendance marking.
*   To maintain a record of your attendance (check-in/check-out times).
*   To improve the accuracy of the facial recognition system locally.

**We do not share, sell, or trade your personal or sensitive information with any third parties.**

## 3. Data Storage and Security

*   **Local Storage**: All data, including your name, attendance records, and facial embeddings, is stored **locally** on your device using a secure SQLite database.
*   **No Cloud Transmission**: This is an offline-first application. Your biometric data is **never** transmitted to any external server or cloud storage by the App.
*   **Security Measures**: We implement reasonable security practices to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## 4. Retaining and Deleting Your Data

*   **Retention**: We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes of attendance tracking or as required by your organization's policy.
